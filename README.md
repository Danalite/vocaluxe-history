# Vocaluxe History

A python script to record the history of songs picked during a [vocaluxe session](https://www.vocaluxe.org/). Uses the vocaluxe webs interface, so
this must be enabled in the vocaluxe config for the script to work, the vocaluxe wiki has a [guide](https://github.com/Vocaluxe/Vocaluxe/wiki/HowTo:-Control-Vocaluxe-with-smartphone-tablet#step-1-enable-server) on how to do this.
